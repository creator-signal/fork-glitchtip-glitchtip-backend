"""Drop the now-unused Issue.search_vector column.

Full-text search reads IssueSearchIndex (populated on ingest + backfilled in
0020); nothing reads or writes Issue.search_vector anymore. Removing it
narrows the hot Issue row (better cache density for issue-list reads) and
reclaims the column from a table too large to hash-partition today -- and
smaller for it, should we ever want to.

DROP COLUMN in Postgres is metadata-only (no table rewrite, O(1) regardless
of row count); the existing column bytes are reclaimed lazily as rows are
next updated. The only cost is the brief ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock. We bound the
wait with ``lock_timeout`` so a busy moment fails fast and is retried, rather
than queueing behind a long query and stalling ingest. The GIN was already
dropped in 0021, so this does not cascade to a large index.

DEPLOY ORDER: this column must be gone only AFTER all code that reads/writes
it has stopped running. Application code in this change no longer touches it,
so drain the old release before applying this migration.
