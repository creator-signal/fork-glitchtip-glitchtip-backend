    Delete Issues whose partitioned data has been dropped.

    maintain_partitions drops old partitions of IssueEvent (daily),
    IssueAggregate (weekly), and IssueTag (weekly) before this runs.
    Because those tables use different partition intervals, an issue's
    events can be dropped before its aggregates/tags — so we must check
    all three partitioned tables are empty before deleting the issue.

    Uses _raw_delete() instead of .delete() to bypass Django's collector,
    which would run unindexed queries against every sub-partition.
    Non-partitioned FK tables (IssueHash, Comment, UserReport) are explicitly
    deleted per batch — Django does not set ON DELETE CASCADE at the DB level.

    NOT EXISTS subqueries short-circuit on the first matching row instead
    of joining all partitions (important for partition-heavy tables).

    If a new FK from a *partitioned* table is added, add an exclude(Exists())
    below. If a new FK from a *non-partitioned* table is added, add it to the
    explicit delete step. Either way, the test will catch the omission.
