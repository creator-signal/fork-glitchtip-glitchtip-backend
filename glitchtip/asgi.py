    """Recycle stale Django DB connections around a mounted ASGI sub-app.

    The MCP Starlette app is mounted directly in the ASGI callable, so its
    requests never pass through Django's ``BaseHandler`` nor the configured
    ``MIDDLEWARE`` — so neither of the hooks that normally return DB
    connections to the pool each request fires for it:

    * ``close_old_connections`` on the ``request_started`` /
      ``request_finished`` signals ``BaseHandler`` emits (the sync,
      thread-local ``django.db.connections`` store); and
    * the ``close_async_connections`` middleware (django-async-backend's
      per-task ``async_connections`` store).

    A connection that dies while held (Postgres failover, pgbouncer restart,
    ``pg_terminate_backend``, a network blip) is therefore never returned to
    the pool: the sub-app pins one dead connection indefinitely and every
    later MCP DB query raises ``OperationalError: the connection is closed``
    until the worker is restarted — while the rest of GlitchTip self-heals,
    because its request path returns connections each request and the pool
    refills with live ones.

    This wrapper restores that per-request recycle for the sub-app. Every MCP
    query — OAuth/token auth and the tool handlers alike — reaches the DB via
    Django's native async ORM (``aget`` / ``async for``), which runs its sync
    work through ``sync_to_async`` on the process-wide thread-sensitive
    executor thread; the connection wrapper therefore lives in the *sync*,
    thread-local store on that one thread. Running ``close_old_connections``
    through ``sync_to_async`` lands it on that same thread, so it recycles the
    exact wrapper those queries use — including the queries the MCP SDK
    dispatches in its stateless child task, which shares the same executor
    thread (no ``ThreadSensitiveContext`` splits the MCP path). MCP does not
    currently touch the ``async_connections`` store, but ``close_old_async_-
    connections`` is called too for parity with the normal request path. On a
    healthy connection both calls are no-ops, so steady-state cost is
    negligible.

    Recovery matches the rest of GlitchTip: a request in flight during the
    switchover may still see a transient error, but the sub-app no longer
    stays wedged afterwards.
